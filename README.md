# New York City Taxi Fare Forecasting

## Introduction

Embarking on a journey to harness machine learning capabilities, this project aims at predicting taxi fares in New York City. Our data originates from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), capturing extensive details from both the iconic yellow taxis and the suburban green taxis.

## Data Overview

-Origin: New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).

-Timeline: Data spans from January 2019 to April 2022.

-Content: Comprehensive records including timestamps, locations, distances, fares, etc.

-Taxi Types:

Yellow Cabs: The ubiquitous NYC taxis, covering the entire city.

Green Cabs: Focused on areas outside the central boroughs.

## Objectives

-Fare Estimation Modeling: Crafting models to estimate fares based on historical data.

-Data Integrity: Tackling challenges such as unique data fields (e.g., 'airport_fee').

## Methodology and Tools

-Data Processing: Commencing with data acquisition and loading into Azure Blob Storage, followed by Databricks processing.

-Modeling Approach: Implementation of Random Forest and Gradient-Boosted Trees Regressor models utilizing PySpark.

## Technology Stack

-Azure Blob Storage for data storage.

-Databricks for data processing and modeling.

-Apache Spark (PySpark) for large-scale data processing.

-Machine Learning: Focus on Random Forest and Gradient-Boosted Trees models.

## Repository Composition

-Data preparation and ingestion scripts.

-Machine learning modeling and optimization notebooks.

-Scripts for performance evaluation and testing.

-Extensive documentation alongside result analyses.
